# TicTacToe_With_AI
Simple tic tac toe game played on the terminal.
Has four play options: 
  1. Human vs Human
  2. Human vs AI
  3. AI vs Human
  4. AI vs AI
  The difference between option 2 and 3 is that the human plays as 'O' in the latter
The size of the board and the number of marks that should be in a line to win can be modified

The code is trash, highly unefficient, absolute garbage, i'll update it every now and then to make it better.
AI is pretty mediocre, easy to trick or predict if you understand how it works, in the future, I'll make it smarter and less predictable.
