# TicTacToe_With_AI
Simple tic tac toe game played on the terminal.
Has four play options: 
  1. Human vs Human
  2. Human vs AI
  3. AI vs Human
  4. AI vs AI

The difference between option 2 and 3 is that the human plays as 'O' in the latter
The size of the board and the number of marks that should be in a line to win can be modified

The code is trash, highly inefficient.
AI is pretty mediocre, easy to trick or predict if you understand how it works.

Todo:

Make ai smarter and less predictable.
